(1) The horizontal axis is the number of layers in the model, representing all the layers in the model.

(2) The floating point number of the vertical axis data represents the difference C between the difference A of the original model's output and the difference B of the mutation model's output under the two frameworks (see **Section 4.3** for the specific calculation formula).

(3) The different colors of each line in the figure represent the number of different rounds of mutation records, recorded once every 5 times, a total of 10 records. The color order of the 10 lines in the figure is defined as follows. For example, a broken line with color number 3 (' orange ') indicates a round 15 mutation.

        colours = ['red', 'blue', 'yellow', 'orange', 'pink', 'purple', 'grey', 'lightseagreen', 'navy', 'lightcoral']
