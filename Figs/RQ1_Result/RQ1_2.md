### PDF image

(1) The folders in **rq1_location_result** and **rq1_singleop_result** are categorized by mutation operators, and each mutation operator folder contains a PDF image describing the experiment results.

(2) The x axis is the mutation rounds, and the recording rules of the mutation rounds are defined below.

|Mutation operator type | Model name | Total rounds of mutation|Every number of rounds saved|

(3) The floating-point number of the Y-axis data represents the difference C between the difference A of the output of the last layer of the original model and the difference B of the output of the last layer of the mutation model under two different frames (see **Section 4.3** of the paper for the specific calculation formula).

        pt refers to the PyTorch framework
        ms refers to the MindSpore framework
        tf refers to the TensorFlow framework

(4) There are 1 to 3 polylines in the figure, which are defined as follows.

        Red indicates pt_ms, the difference between PyTorch and Mindspore frameworks
        Blue indicates pt_tf, the difference between PyTorch and TensorFlow frameworks
        Yellow indicates ms_tf, the difference between MindSpore and TensorFlow frameworks

If -100 appears in result C, the model is considered to have failed to mutate in the current frame, and the corresponding polyline will not be drawn.
