### DL Framework Testing via Model Mutation: How Far Are We?

This is the implementation repository of our ESEC/FSE 2024 paper:  **Deep Learning Library Testing via Effective Model Generation.**
#### Description ####
In this work, we employed 11 classic DL model mutation operators and collected a total of 11 classic deep learning models from 7 scenario tasks. We conducted empirical research on three popular DL frameworks: PyTorch, MindSpore, and TensorFlow. Due to paper length limitations, we reported results that were not presented in the paper in this open-source repository. If you have any questions, please leave a message here to contact us. The following explains the organizational structure of the result files on this repository.
